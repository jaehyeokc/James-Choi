# Interest in IT

My interest in IT started when I first watched the film called Iron-man 2008. I'm sure you've at least heard of the film. I was 11 years old and I went nuts about it. Bought the Iron-man figurine, toys, comics, everything I could gather. When I got really passionate about IT was when I first heard about Elon Musk. He was like the real life Tony Stark from Iron-man. The things he has achieved so far and things that he is trying to achieve... with technology, made me fascinated and sparked my interest more than ever. 

I chose to come to RMIT as it is one of the best universities in Australia for learning Technology. And why not learn from the best while you're at it?

I expect to learn the fundamental basics when it comes to Information Technology before moving onto any other topics. Without a strong base, the fundamentals, no matter the quality of the skyscraper you're trying to build, it will collapse sooner or later. Once the basics are covered, I expect to learn more in depth about programming itself and to become a competent and skillful programmer.

This job positions appeals to me as a student who is studying IT, as it opens up a lot of opportunities in regards to different pathways you can pursue as a career.


**Minimum qualifications are as follows:**


Currently pursuing a BS, MS or PhD in Computer Science
Experienced with one or more programming language
Have a strong understanding of Data Structures or Algorithms

The skills, qualifications and experience I currently have are very minimal and not up to the level yet to apply for this position. I will practice programming on a daily basis to get my level of competencies up to par and continue with my university studies and study data structures and algorithms on the side. On top of that I will aim to complete a project whether that is big or small; one project per two months on top of all my current work that I am doing.

The results of these tests mean that I'm the type of person who tends to be creative, inspiring and convincing as well as decisive when it came to the Myers-Briggs test.<br/>
When it comes to the learning style: I'm a auditory and visual learner.<br/>

These results may have a positive influence when working in a team as being able to plan out the goal when it comes to projects in the very beginning and being able to choose which team member does certain work and being decisive in order to have the best possible outcome for the team. Being a auditory and visual learn means that I'll be able to connect with most of the learning styles with most of the team members as around 87% of the people are either auditory or visual learners or combination of both.<br/>

When forming a team, it's important to be able to form a team with similar learning styles so there is no conflict between teammates but having a variety of different personality traits within a team is also an important factor as having a different qualities and perspective can bring positive end results.
