# Interest in IT

My interest in IT started when I first watched the film called Iron-man 2008. I'm sure you've at least heard of the film. I was 11 years old and I went nuts about it. Bought the Iron-man figurine, toys, comics, everything I could gather. When I got really passionate about IT was when I first heard about Elon Musk. He was like the real life Tony Stark from Iron-man. The things he has achieved so far and things that he is trying to achieve... with technology, made me fascinated and sparked my interest more than ever. 

I chose to come to RMIT as it is one of the best universities in Australia for learning Technology. And why not learn from the best while you're at it?

I expect to learn the fundamental basics when it comes to Information Technology before moving onto any other topics. Without a strong base, the fundamentals, no matter the quality of the skyscraper you're trying to build, it will collapse sooner or later. Once the basics are covered, I expect to learn more in depth about programming itself and to become a competent and skillful programmer.

The results of these tests mean that I'm the type of person who tends to be creative, inspiring and convincing as well as decisive when it came to the Myers-Briggs test.<br/>
When it comes to the learning style: I'm a auditory and visual learner.<br/>

These results may have a positive influence when working in a team as being able to plan out the goal when it comes to projects in the very beginning and being able to choose which team member does certain work and being decisive in order to have the best possible outcome for the team. Being a auditory and visual learn means that I'll be able to connect with most of the learning styles with most of the team members as around 87% of the people are either auditory or visual learners or combination of both.<br/>

When forming a team, it's important to be able to form a team with similar learning styles so there is no conflict between teammates but having a variety of different personality traits within a team is also an important factor as having a different qualities and perspective can bring positive end results.<br/>

# Project Idea

## Overview – summary of what the project will be 


Developing a built-in-home Voice Activation Ordering System which will enable users to experience hands free, convenient way of ordering essential goods or services. This will be a great way to target millennials and their evolving ordering habits. Furthermore, users will be able to take full advantage of being able to multi-task while efficiently and securely placing an order. In order to protect impulse buying or multiple purchases, the system will be able to recognize double orders of same item or numerous repeat orders from users and send off a warning message to their phones to confirm their purchase manually. Moreover, the system will be able to recognize the user’s voice and it’ll be a voice recognition that will be used as part of a security check before the user is able to purchase anything.

## Motivation – why will this be useful? What are the stats and facts?


![stats](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62459675/77249620-a3f72a00-6c96-11ea-8d26-e8311f7aa31d.png)


The motivation behind this start-up project is to already ride the current wave of millennials being too lazy to go out and enjoy the good old traditional way of eating in a venue or a restaurant. As days go by more and more people are using the currently popular app UberEATS to get their food delivered to their doorsteps while they are already playing their favorite show in the background in their living room. “Australians are spending an incredible $2.6 billion each year on food and drink delivery through companies such as Menulog, UberEATS, Deliveroo and Foodora” and the spending will only grow. (According to article written by news.com.au). Being able to take full advantage of current habits of millennials wanting more convenience in their lives will make this start-up a great success. 

## Description – features and benefits of products in detail


To start of with, let’s discuss the benefits of a voice recognition technology in our society. We will be able to minimize and perhaps get rid of all possibility of incurring an error when it comes to consumer purchases. By being able to order using your voice, you’ll be able to articulate exactly what you want, when you want and how much you want. This means that as a user you’ll be able to have the confidence that there will be no accidental manual mistakes when making a purchase online. On the other hand, it is also good for businesses, especially small to medium sized businesses. In cases where customer tries to claim their money back for not receiving an order or making a mistake on their order, they will have voice recording to go back on as proof to provide as an evidence to the users. It means that the ability to order will be highly accurate with no possibility of making a mistake, unless it is a technical glitch.<br/>


It’ll also increase our level of productivity as we will have less need to physically be present in front of a device to order products. For example, if you are cooking and notice that one of the key ingredients in your dish is missing, however, your hands are tied, you’ll be able to quickly and efficiently order the necessary item without having to wash your hands, pick up your phone, search it up, double check it is the right one, and finally confirming the order.<br/>


Features of this technology will involve first activating the system with your voice. This will simultaneously recognize the user and unlock the software so the user can use it seamlessly without having to go through the “security step”. The user will then be able to specify the things they want from participating merchants and within a specific category. Then, all they need to do is confirm their order by stating their preferred delivered time and date and quantity. The system will automatically send an order confirmation email directly to their inbox.<br/>


Within the next 5 minutes of confirming their order, they will have the ability to change or cancel their order. This benefit will be free of charge to the user and won’t cost them any cancellation fee or change-of-mind fee. However, if the algorithm notices a habit of the user forming a repetitive habit of cancelling, it’ll warn them and will start charging a small fee. This is just to make sure that users do not abuse the system design to provide extra convenience. 
Additionally, once the order is received from the user, the tracking system will automatically get triggered and send an email asking about their experience about the product they have ordered and leave a review.<br/>

## Tools and Technologies – Software/ hardware/ other equipment


Software that will be crucial to making this project work will be Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). It is a technology that converts spoken words into text. In short, it is the first step in enabling voice technologies such as a well-known Amazon Alexa to respond when we ask, “Alexa, what’s it like outside?”. Other necessary technologies needed to build a project like this would be a Voice/Speech to text (STT) – which is the process of converting speech signal into digital data (i.e. text data). The voice will come as a file or a stream and you can use CMU Sphinx for its processing. You would require Text to speech (TTS) – this is the opposite process that translates text in a human speech. Next, Intelligent tagging and decision making would come in hand. It would serve for interpreting the user’s request.

## Skills Required


Skills that are required to complete this project with great efficiencies and successful outcome would be bringing on team members who are not only capable of doing the basic skills mentioned above but also being able to perform and have an extensive knowledge when it comes to programming and how technology works. Being able to work with creating a noise control technology as well as Voice Biometrics is very important to achieve the features that we would want to have in this project. Not only that, speech compression and voice interface would come in handy – as these two additional materials will help complete the project in full.

## Outcome


![thought-desired-outcome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62459675/77249666-def95d80-6c96-11ea-999f-ba1f6b26040b.jpg)


Once the start-up project is finished and successful – the outcome and the result will be astonishing. It will be something that will take a bit of time to get popular and widely used however as someone who’s continuously seeking ways that technology can make our lives better, it will soon take over how consumers purchase online goods; whether that’s food, essential items, groceries or personal items, etc. This will bring more productivity into our daily lives, just like how being able to order online is helping all of us save time by being efficient and quick. 

**This project will begin 2021 and we plan to complete this by 2023 and have a beta version tested by the market by then.**
