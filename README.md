# Interest in IT

My interest in IT started when I first watched the film called Iron-man 2008. I'm sure you've at least heard of the film. I was 11 years old and I went nuts about it. Bought the Iron-man figurine, toys, comics, everything I could gather. When I got really passionate about IT was when I first heard about Elon Musk. He was like the real life Tony Stark from Iron-man. The things he has achieved so far and things that he is trying to achieve... with technology, made me fascinated and sparked my interest more than ever. 

I chose to come to RMIT as it is one of the best universities in Australia for learning Technology. And why not learn from the best while you're at it?

I expect to learn the fundamental basics when it comes to Information Technology before moving onto any other topics. Without a strong base, the fundamentals, no matter the quality of the skyscraper you're trying to build, it will collapse sooner or later. Once the basics are covered, I expect to learn more in depth about programming itself and to become a competent and skillful programmer.

The job advertisement itself. Include a link, and a snapshot of it (in case the link
expires before the assignment deadline).
• A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this
position appealing to you.
• A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required
for the position.
• A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you
currently have.
• A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required
for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed,
(and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as
you can
