# Interest in IT

My interest in IT started when I first watched the film called Iron-man 2008. I'm sure you've at least heard of the film. I was 11 years old and I went nuts about it. Bought the Iron-man figurine, toys, comics, everything I could gather. When I got really passionate about IT was when I first heard about Elon Musk. He was like the real life Tony Stark from Iron-man. The things he has achieved so far and things that he is trying to achieve... with technology, made me fascinated and sparked my interest more than ever. 

I chose to come to RMIT as it is one of the best universities in Australia for learning Technology. And why not learn from the best while you're at it?

I expect to learn the fundamental basics when it comes to Information Technology before moving onto any other topics. Without a strong base, the fundamentals, no matter the quality of the skyscraper you're trying to build, it will collapse sooner or later. Once the basics are covered, I expect to learn more in depth about programming itself and to become a competent and skillful programmer.
