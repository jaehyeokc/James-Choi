# Interest in IT

My interest in IT started when I first watched the film called Iron-man 2008. I'm sure you've at least heard of the film. I was 11 years old and I went nuts about it. Bought the Iron-man figurine, toys, comics, everything I could gather. When I got really passionate about IT was when I first heard about Elon Musk. He was like the real life Tony Stark from Iron-man. The things he has achieved so far and things that he is trying to achieve... with technology, made me fascinated and sparked my interest more than ever. 

I chose to come to RMIT as it is one of the best universities in Australia for learning Technology. And why not learn from the best while you're at it?

I expect to learn the fundamental basics when it comes to Information Technology before moving onto any other topics. Without a strong base, the fundamentals, no matter the quality of the skyscraper you're trying to build, it will collapse sooner or later. Once the basics are covered, I expect to learn more in depth about programming itself and to become a competent and skillful programmer.

There are variety of opportunities and areas you can work on including but not limited to: information retrieval, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking and data storage, security, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, UI design and mobile. 

As a software engineer, you will work on a specific project critical to Googleâ€™s needs with opportunities to switch teams and projects as you and our fast-paced business grow and evolve. We need our engineers to be versatile, display leadership qualities and be enthusiastic to take on new problems across the full-stack as we continue to push technology forward.

This job positions appeals to me as a student who is studying IT, as it opens up a lot of opportunities in regards to different pathways you can pursue as a career.

**Minimum qualifications are as follows:**

Currently pursuing a BS, MS or PhD in Computer Science
Experienced with one or more programming language
Have a strong understanding of Data Structures or Algorithms

The skills, qualifications and experience I currently have are very minimal and not up to the level yet to apply for this position. I will practice programming on a daily basis to get my level of competencies up to par and continue with my university studies and study data structures and algorithms on the side. On top of that I will aim to complete a project whether that is big or small; one project per two months on top of all my current work that I am doing.
